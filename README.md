== Description ==

The [Open Source Event Calendar](https://github.com/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar) is based on the Timely All-in-one-event-calendar version v2.3.4. by [Timely](http://time.ly/). The calendar system combines clean visual design with a basic set of features to create share and aggregate Events in WordPress. Ical import is possible.

This Plugin is open source software in traditional sense. I pledge this plugin will not urge you to connect to any proprietary/payed service to use described features.

Osec calendar is most likely not compatible with any previous All-in-one-event-calendar release, but with some effort you might get it working.

= Import and Export Events =

Osec offers **full ics/ical support**. You can import events from other calendars and offer users the ability to subscribe to your calendar.

Importing and exporting iCalendar (.ics) feeds is one of the strongest features of the Event Calendar system.  This allows you to manage your websites calendar by providing a public calendar from your Google, Apple or other calendar management software.    

You can even send events from a specific category or tag (or combination of categories and tags).

= This is a fork = 

This is a fork of the GPL licensed plugin All-in-on-Event-Calendar by Timely.
At it's time a great plugin with a solid but unmaintainable codebase (not all required developer tools where opensourced).

In later releases of the original softeware was deprived of core feature: Importing iCal feeds in favor of a service provided by Timely.

If you need a professionally supported plugin you should consider using the [original all in one event calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/)

If you love truly open source software and don't mind to get your hands dirty you should join here. Free people need free software to manage and share events in a selfhosted manner.

Please do not ask for support at Time.ly for this Plugin.

Source and developer support you can find at [Plugin's github page](https://github.com/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar). There is also a [public CircleCI build pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar?filter=all)

== Features == 

* **Import and Exportof Ical feeds** without additional addons.
  * Import other calendars automatically to display in your calendar.
  * Categorize and tag imported calendar feeds automatically.
* **Recurring events** including complex patterns.
* **Filtering** by event category or tag.
* Easy **sharing** with Google Calendar, Apple iCal, MS Outlook and
any other system that accepts iCalendar (.ics) feeds.
* Embedded Google Maps (may be outdated)
* **Color-coded** events based on category.
* Featured **event images** and **category images**.
* **Month**, **week**, **day**, **agenda** views.
* **Upcoming Events** block.
* Direct links to **filtered calendar views**.
* **Theme** options to customize your calendar appearence (based on bootstrap 3)
* Each event is SEO-optimized.
* Each event links to the original calendar.
* Your calendar can be embedded into a WordPress page without needing
to create template files or modify the theme.

== Requirements ==

* PHP >= 8.2 is currently required at least for development. PHP 8.1 may work too with release version (using `composer install --no-dev`).

== Languages ==  

This Plugin supports multiple languages. 


== Blocks == 

You can embed the calendar by adding a **Osec Calendar** Block to any page or post. Alternatively there is a schortcode available. 

Please note that by this time (most likely) only one Calendar per page/post-List will work 

On the long run its planed to have a Rest API to allow the calendar being rendered with more modern frontend tools than the current, outdated, but nice old Bootstrap 3 stuff.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I accelerate future development =

The principle behind this plugin is to be Open Source.
So you might get in touch on github accelerate development.

Writing this fork was [a huge effort](https://github.com/wp-plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/compare/master...digitaldonkey:open-source-event-calendar:master).

Digitaldonkey believes everybody should be able to set up and manage public calendars. 

If you are implementing this plugin for others you should support ongoing development with a [donnation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZNWEQRQNJBTE6) or [contribution](https://github.com/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar/issues).
